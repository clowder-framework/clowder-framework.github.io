Next Clowder Webinar is **Friday, November 6, 2020 at 11:00 CST**. 

[Join us by Zoom](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/confluence/display/CATS/All+Paws+Webinars).

**Rob Kooper**, Lead Research Programmer, will discuss **Helm Deployment of Clowder**. Kubernetes has become the de-facto standard for docker orchestration, and helm a well-established method for deploying applications. We will describe the helm chart that can be used to quickly install clowder in kubernetes. We will go over the customization options as well as how to upgrade clowder.

**Mark Fredrickson**, Research Programmer, will discuss **Clowder Transformations Catalog**. The Transformations Catalog is designed as a catalog for extractors that may be used with Clowder. People can submit created extractors for advertisement to the wider Clowder community.
